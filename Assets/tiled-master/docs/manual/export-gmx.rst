GameMaker: Studio 1.4
---------------------

GameMaker: Studio 1.4 uses a custom XML-based format to store its rooms,
and Tiled ships with a plugin to export maps in this format. Currently
only orthogonal maps will export correctly.

Tile layers and tile objects (when no type is set) will export as "tile"
elements. These support horizontal and vertical flipping, but no
rotation. For tile objects, scaling is also supported.

.. warning::

   The tilesets have to be named the same as the corresponding backgrounds
   in the GameMaker project. Otherwise GameMaker will pop up an error for each
   tile while loading the exported ``room.gmx`` file.

Object Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GameMaker object instances are created by putting the object name in the
"Type" field of the object in Tiled. Rotation is supported here, and for
tile objects also flipping and scaling is supported (though flipping in
combination with rotation doesn't appear to work in GameMaker).

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.1</div>

The following custom properties can be set on objects to affect the
exported instance:

* string ``code`` (instance creation code, default: "")
* float ``scaleX`` (default: derived from tile or 1.0)
* float ``scaleY`` (default: derived from tile or 1.0)
* int ``originX`` (default: 0)
* int ``originY`` (default: 0)

The ``scaleX`` and ``scaleY`` properties can be used to override the
scale of the instance. However, if the scale is relevant then it will
generally be easier to use a tile object, in which case it is
automatically derived from the tile size and the object size.

The ``originX`` and ``originY`` properties can be used to tell Tiled
about the origin of the object defined in GameMaker, as an offset from
the top-left. This origin is taken into account when determining the
position of the exported instance.

.. hint::

   Of course setting the type and/or the above properties manually for
   each instance will get old fast. Since Tiled 1.0.2, you can instead
   use tile objects with the type set on the tile, and in Tiled 1.1 you
   can also use :doc:`object templates <using-templates>`.

Views
~~~~~

   :alt: GameMaker View Settings
   :align: right

Views can be defined using :ref:`rectangle objects <insert-rectangle-tool>`
where the Type has been set to ``view``. The position and size will be
snapped to pixels. Whether the view is visible when the room starts
depends on whether the object is visible. The use of views is
automatically enabled when any views are defined.

The following custom properties can be used to define the various other
properties of the view:

**Port on screen**

* int ``xport`` (default: 0)
* int ``yport`` (default: 0)
* int ``wport`` (default: 1024)
* int ``hport`` (default: 768)

**Object following**

* string ``objName``
* int ``hborder`` (default: 32)
* int ``vborder`` (default: 32)
* int ``hspeed`` (default: -1)
* int ``vspeed`` (default: -1)

.. hint::

   When you're defining views in Tiled, it is useful to add ``view``
   as class in the :ref:`Custom Types Editor <custom-property-types>`,
   adding the above properties for ease of access. If you frequently use
   views with similar settings, you can set up
   :doc:`templates <using-templates>` for them.

Map Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General
^^^^^^^

* int ``speed`` (default: 30)
* bool ``persistent`` (default: false)
* bool ``clearDisplayBuffer`` (default: true)
* bool ``clearViewBackground`` (default: false)
* string ``code`` (map creation code, default: "")

Physics
^^^^^^^

* bool ``PhysicsWorld`` (default: false)
* int ``PhysicsWorldTop`` (default: 0)
* int ``PhysicsWorldLeft`` (default: 0)
* int ``PhysicsWorldRight`` (default: width of map in pixels)
* int ``PhysicsWorldBottom`` (default: height of map in pixels)
* float ``PhysicsWorldGravityX`` (default: 0.0)
* float ``PhysicsWorldGravityY`` (default: 10.0)
* float ``PhysicsWorldPixToMeters`` (default: 0.1)

Layer Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both tile layers and object layers may produce "tile" elements in the exported
room file. Their depth is set automatically, with tiles from the bottom-most
layer getting a value of 10000000 (the GameMaker default) and counting up from
there. If you want to set a custom depth value you can set the following
property on the layer:

* int ``depth`` (default: 10000000 + N)
